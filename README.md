This repository contains various projects demonstrating register-level programming on Arduino. Register-level programming gives you more direct control over the microcontroller's hardware by interacting with its registers, rather than relying on high-level libraries. This approach allows you to write more efficient and optimized code, which is particularly useful in embedded systems where resources are limited.
